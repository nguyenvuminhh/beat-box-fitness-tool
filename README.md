# BeatBox

## General Description

An Arduino project that helps people engage more in physical activities. It is a device that is strapped to the user's wrist like a watch. After being turned on, it will detect the user's punches, then play a note in a song. These played notes when put together will create a song, and the song can be set by importing it via USB cabel.
## Components

- Arduino Nano
- CMS-28528N-L152B speaker
- Bbreadboard
- Button
- Light-emitting diode (LED)
- ADXL335 acceleromete

## Features

- After a user's punch, the device produce a melodic note in
response to the motion. The sequence of played notes is harmonized into a song; hence, users
can compose melodies, turning every interaction into a musical masterpiece.
- Beatbox can assess statistics, thus evaluating usersâ€™ improvement. It can measure the velocity
of a punch, and number of punches thrown per second This feature allows users to track their punch
frequency and set goals for improvement. The feedback provided by BeatBox enables users to
make informed decisions about their training routine, fostering a sense of achievement and
progress.
